PostToFacebook
==============

A simple Android app integrated with the Facebook SDK. 

This lets you share stuff from within your app to Facebook. It requires the Facebook native app to be present
on the same device. 

If the user is not currently logged in, it will prompt the user to log in before taking them to the 'Share Status' 
screen.
